Library Management System
This project is a Library Management System implemented in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It simulates a bookstore or library where users can manage inventory, search for items, place orders, and track sales. The system supports different types of items, such as books, magazines, and DVDs, each with unique attributes.

Features
1.	Item Management:
o	Add, remove, and update items in the inventory.
o	Items include books, magazines, and DVDs, each with specific details (e.g., title, author, price, genre, etc.).
2.	Search Functionality:
o	Search for items by name, author, or genre.
3.	Order Management:
o	Place orders for items in the inventory.
o	Track orders and calculate total sales.
4.	User Interaction:
o	A command-line interface (CLI) allows users to interact with the system.
o	Users can view inventory, search for items, place orders, and view sales.

Classes and Structure
•	Item (Abstract Base Class):
o	Defines common attributes and methods for all items (e.g., title, author, price).
o	Includes abstract methods like get_details() and get_genre().
•	Book (Subclass of Item):
o	Represents books with additional attributes like genre and num_pages.
•	Magazine (Subclass of Item):
o	Represents magazines with attributes like issue_number, publication_date, and editor.
•	DVD (Subclass of Item):
o	Represents DVDs with attributes like director, duration, and genre.
•	Bookstore:
o	Manages the inventory, orders, and sales.
o	Provides methods to add/remove items, search for items, place orders, and display sales.

How It Works
1.	The system starts by initializing a Bookstore object and adding sample items to the inventory (e.g., books, magazines, DVDs).
2.	Users interact with the system through a menu-driven interface:
o	View the inventory.
o	Search for items by name, author, or genre.
o	Place orders for items.
o	View all orders and total sales.
3.	The system handles exceptions (e.g., invalid input) and ensures smooth operation.

Technologies Used
•	Python: The core programming language used for implementation.
•	OOP Concepts: Inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction are used to structure the code.
•	Command-Line Interface (CLI): Provides a simple and intuitive way for users to interact with the system.

How to Run
1.	Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
2.	Navigate to the project folder: cd your-repo-name
3.	Run the Python script: python main.py
4.	Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the system.

Future Improvements
•	Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
•	Implement a database to store inventory and orders persistently.
•	Add user authentication for secure access.
•	Support more item types (e.g., audiobooks, e-books).
